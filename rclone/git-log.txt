    random: seed math/rand in one place with crypto strong seed #4783
    
    This shouldn't be read as encouraging the use of math/rand instead of
    crypto/rand in security sensitive contexts, rather as a safer default
    if that does happen by accident.

    sharefile: fix backend due to API swapping integers for strings
    
    For some reason the API started returning some integers as strings in
    JSON. This is probably OK in Javascript but it upsets Go.
    
    This is easily fixed with the `json:"name,size"` struct tag.

    vfs: fix vfs/refresh calls with fs= parameter
    
    Before this change rclone gave an error when the fs parameter was
    provided.
    
    This change removes the fs parameter from the parameters once it has
    been read which avoids the error.
